				<h2>Ear Training HQ has shut down permanently</h2>
				<p>Hi there,</p>

					<p>I feel mixed emotions as I sit to write this.</p><br>
					
					<p>After a lot of reflection, I’ve decided that the time has come to close Ear Training HQ down.</p><br>
					
					<p>It’s been 10 years since I started this journey and it’s been a huge part of my life ever since. There have been some amazing times and some incredibly tough challenges along the way. And while I continue to be incredibly proud of what musicians have achieved with ETHQ, it has struggled more and more to cover it’s costs over the last couple of years, and it has finally reached a point where I need to say goodbye and move onto new things.</p>
					<br>
					<p>This has been a difficult decision, but I know it’s the right one.</p>
					<br>							
					<p>And finally, I’d like to say thank you. it’s the amazing musicians that I’ve worked with that have made my journey with ETHQ such an incredible experience. It would have been nothing without you all, and I’m deeply grateful for your support for the last 10 years.</p>
					<br>
					<p>If you were a customer and have any questions please email me.

					For 
					</p>
					
					<p>Cheers,</p>
					
					<p>Scott</p>
